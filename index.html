        <p>The original meaning of console as it related to computers was (1) an instrument panel containing the controls for a computer. The term evolved along with advances in computer technology to also mean (2) the combination of the display monitor and a keyboard connected to a computer and (3) equipment, including a display monitor and a keyboard, connected to a minicomputer, mainframe or supercomputer that is used to monitor the status of the system. Another term for console as used in this sense is terminal.</P>
